       <p><h3>Protein Consumption:</h3><br><br>
        We Indians often believe that high-protein diets are dangerous to kidney and overall health. And due to which quite frequently we completely overlook the importance of dietary protein in our dishes. A study conducted with an explicit aim to find a relation between protein intake and kidney function found that healthy individuals (with no pre-existing renal disease) showed no signs of harm in renal function upon consuming over 2.0 grams of protein per kg of bodyweight.
        
        Another research set to examine the safety concerns for athletes and bodybuilders with high-protein diet concluded that no link could be made between high protein diets and heart disease.
        
        To sum up, following what the recent studies say, high-protein diet (above 1 gram of protein per pound of bodyweight) do not show adverse health risks, at least for healthy individuals, athletes, and bodybuilders.</p>

        <br><br><p><h2>Carbs Consumption:</h2></br>
                You may have always wondered how many carbs I should really take to build muscles. Well, that’s quite easy to determine.
                Fact – 1 gram of carbohydrate contains four calories. Now assume that you probably need around 3000 calories per day to get bigger.
                If we go by the recommendations, your daily calorie intake should comprise of 45%-55% of calories from carbs. Calculating by simple math, we get 375 grams of carbs every day.
                
                However, everyone has different calorie intake (hence different carb intake ratio) based on their goals, fitness level, and metabolic rate.
                
                
                <br><br><h2>Fats Consumption:</h2></br>
                Like carbs, fats also makes you feel full after a meal. Eating unprocessed fats found in nuts, olives, and avocados should be highly preferred over processed fat and oil products. At least 10%-20% of your total calories should come from healthy fats like polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats along with saturated fat found in egg yolks, cheese, and other poultry items.

                Vitamin And Fibre Consumption:
                Stop me if it sounds wrong, vitamins are so underrated in every bodybuilder’s diet. All you think about is protein and more protein which eventually leads to the negligence of micronutrient, especially vitamins. But now you will have to take some time and plan your micro nutrients now before it gets too late.
                
                One of the very vital vitamins that every Indian bodybuilder and athlete should get is Vitamin D. It is helpful in strengthening bone, brain health, protein synthesis, and hormone synthesis. Other important vitamins that no bodybuilder should ignore are Vitamins B, C, and E.
                
                Similarly, fibres are very crucial part of every Indian bodybuilder’s diet plan. Fibres have a broad range of benefits including – decreasing LDL levels, fighting against cancer, stabilizing blood sugar levels and killing constipation.</p>

                        The importance of pre-breakfast meal:
                        A pre-breakfast meal or wake-up meal is very crucial for bodybuilders and athletes who are eyeing to put on some mass and size. When you wake up after a sleep of 7-10 hours, your body is already at the highest level of catabolic state of the day. It means that your body is now burning your lean muscle tissue as a fuel for functioning.
                        
                        So, your first preference should be getting out of this catabolic zone as quick as possible. Consuming a pre-breakfast meal containing fast protein and high GI fruits right after awakening will help you in getting over the catabolic state.

                        <b>The importance of Breakfast:</b></br> Out of the three basic meals of the day (breakfast, lunch and dinner), breakfast is by far the most important meal for your fitness goals. Breakfast sets up the tone and influences our performance both mentally and physically throughout the day. Apart from providing much-needed energy, protein, and carbohydrate-rich breakfast also restores the blood glucose to normal after the night’s fast.
                        
                        During initial hours of our sleep, our body uses blood glucose and liver glycogen as a fuel to fulfil its energy requirements. However, by the time we wake up, our glycogen stores and blood glucose are already running low. Now to prevent further declination in these stores, cortisol level rises in the body.
                        
                        Cortisol also known as stress hormone is responsible for the breakdown of muscle protein and fat to derive the energy. If you don’t refuel your body with nutritious breakfast, cortisol levels will remain high. And prolonged exposure to elevated levels of cortisol will negatively affect your athletic performance over the span of time.</p>

                        <b>The importance of Mid-Morning Meal –</b> There’s a vast difference in how your body reacts when you eat 2000 calories in two meals and when you eat the same 2000 calories in three major meals and two snacks. The point is that eating smaller meals or spreading out calories in 4-5 meals helps your body to metabolize those calories efficiently.
                        
                        
                         
                        In fact, snacking also breaks those long hours of fast between meals that often led to overeating and weight gain. Get in a moderate amount of protein and slow-carb like sweet potato along with fibrous vegetable like broccoli for this meal.<br>
